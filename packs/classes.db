They are spiritual leaders, the voice of the gods, and interpreters of omens. While trained in combat, their primary skill is the use of divine magic, either through channeling spells, or channeling direct magical effects such as turning undead. Inspirational sources for clerics include Van Helsing, the Zulu Sangoma, Odo of Bayeux, or high priests/priestesses of Norse or Greek mythology.\n\n### Deity Options\n* **Adventuring**: It should be no surprise that many\nadventurers would be drawn to a deity that\nencourages and preaches the thrill of the adventure.\nIf your diety(s) have this sphere, you gain certain\nbenefits, the first being a +1 bonus to all saving\nthrow rolls. Secondly, by presenting your holy\nsymbol in a tavern or inn, you can get a discount of\n25% on all goods and services. You also gain a +1\nbonus to all ability checks when trying to find secret\ndoors, traps, or hidden items. You can also cast the\ncreate food and water spell as a first level spell once\nper day for free.\n* **Knowledge**: Libraries are your church. You\ncannot wear any metal armor, but you gain other\nbenefits. Firstly, you can prepare locate object\nas a 1st level spell, commune as a 3rd level spell,\nand you have access to prepare the following\nwizard spells (of the same level): comprehend\nlanguages, erase, find familiar, unseen servant,\nwrite, detect invisibility, wizard lock, explosive runes,\ntongues, enchant weapon, and contact other plane.\nAdditionally, you learn 2 additional languages of\nyour choice, and can casts identify at-will without\nspending a spell slot.\n* **Life**: Your teachings focus on healing and nurturing\nthe wounded. You can only use a staff or sling\nfor weapons, and only in self defense or in the\ndefense of others. Your healing spells are more\npotent however, allowing you to treat all 1s and 2s\nrolled to be treated as 3 instead. You can cast cure\ndisease and neutralize poison once per day without\nspending a spell slot. Additionally, you can prepare\nthe raise dead spell as a 4th level spell, rather than\nthe 5th level spell it normally is.\n* **Nature**: You have an affinity for nature, and will\ndo anything to protect it. Unlike druids, who get\ntheir powers from rituals and spirits, you worship\nan actual entity from whom you get your powers.\nYou gain proficiency in the battle axe, hand axe,\nshortbow, longbow, and spear, but cannot wear\nmetal armor. One spell slot of each spell level that\nyou prepare can be from the druid spell list. I.e., if\nyou can prepare three 1st level and two 2nd level\nspells, one 1st and one 2nd can be from the druid\nspell list.\n* **Necromancy**: You prefer the company of\ngraveyards and corpses to those of crowds of the\nliving. Most avoid you at best, and some treat you\nas an aberration. You can prepare the animate\ndead spell as a 2nd level spell, but if you cast it as\na 3rd level spell, the target corpse will be a ghoul,\nand if you cast it as a 4th level spell, it will be a\nghast. All skeletons would have 1 additional HD.\n* **Protection**: Protecting yourself and others are\nyour primary ethos. You can learn any spell from\nthe abjuration school, regardless of class spell list.\nAdditionally, you can take your action to take up\na divine protection stance. While in this stance, an\naura surrounds you in a 10ft radius, emanating from\nyour holy symbol. Any ally that is within this radius\nwill gain a +2 bonus to their AC and saving throws.\nYou can enact this once per day, and it will last up\nto one round per cleric level. You may move and\ntake actions while maintainingg this stance, but cannot\ncast spells while doing so.\n* **War**: You have practiced combat alongside the\nwarriors during your religious training. You will use\nthe warrior combat table when determining your\nattack roll bonus. You also gain proficiency with all\nweapons. When you reach 7th level, you may take\nan additional attack per round. You can split your\nattacks up between moving and actions, but they\nmust both be in the same round.","classGroup":"divine","xp":0,"requirements":{"str":0,"int":0,"wis":10,"dex":0,"con":0,"cha":9},"features":{"82a6bmz0upti9n9k":{"level":1,"title":"Spellcasting","content":"Clerics can prepare and cast\nclerical spells in accordance with the spell casting\ntable above.

The drawback, however, is they have a\nsmaller pool of spells to choose from, and a smaller\nnumber of spells they know at any given time. While\nsorcerers can cast spells from arcane scrolls as long as\nthe spell is a sorcerer spell, they cannot learn spells\nfrom scrolls or spellbooks.\n\nSorcerers use a pool of energy to channel their\nspells from, which is represented by spell points.\nUnlike wizards, they don’t have a set number of spells\nper level they can cast, so disregard that portion\nof the Arcane Experience Table above. Spell points\nregenerate at a rate of 10% of the total pool every\nhour of rest, rounded up .5 or higher. Thus a sorcerer\nwith a maximum spell point pool of 32 points would\nregenerate 3 points for every hour they rested.\n\n### Sorcerer Spell Casting and Learning\n\nThe chart on the Spellcasting tab will advise you how many total\nspells your PC has learned, what the maximum level\nspell they can cast is, and the spell point total they will\nhave acquired. At first level the sorcerer will choose\ntwo spells from the sorcerer spell list to learn. Each\ntime a level is gained and the appropriate additional\nnumber of spells known increases, the sorcerer can\nreplace one previously learned spell with a new spell.\nEvery spell must come from the sorcerer spell list unless\notherwise noted.\n\nEach level of spell cast will cost a number of spell\npoints as described below:\n\n| Spell Level | Point Cost|\n| --- | --- |\n| 1 |  2 |\n| 2 | 3| \n| 3 | 5| \n| 4 | 7| \n| 5 | 9| \n| 6 | 12| \n| 7 | 15| \n| 8 | 18| \n| 9 | 21|\n\n### Sorcerous Origin Options\n* **Draconic**: Your skin takes on a scaly appearance\nand the color of the chosen dragon. You suffer only\nhalf damage from damage types of that dragon’s\nbreath weapon. I.e., if you choose black dragon,\nyou suffer only half damage from all acid damage.\nAt 8th level, you can exhale a breath weapon\nattack once per day. This breath weapon is similar in type and size to an appropriate dragon’s,\ninflicting 1d6 points of damage per level of the\nsorcerer. At 12th level, the sorcerer can sprout\nwings at will, granting a flying speed of 40ft per\nround.\n* **Celestial**: Your body begins to radiate a holy\naura. You gain a bonus +2 bonus to all saving\nthrows. At 8th level, you sprout angelic wings and\ncan fly at a speed of 60ft per round. At 12th level,\nyou are immune to undead special attacks (level\ndraining, paralyzation, etc).\n* **Fiendish**: Your eyes glow a slight reddish color\nand small horns sprout from your head. You take\nonly half damage from fire damage and all fire\nspells deal an additional +1 bonus to each damage\ndie. At 8th level, you gain an additional 1 HP per\nlevel, retroactively. At 12th level, your fire spells\ncost 1 less spell point (minimum 1).\n* **Fey**: Your skin takes on a bronze appearance, and\ninsects and small woodland animals seem to flock to\nyou. You are immune to sleep and charm magic. If\nyou are already immune to these, then you can cast\ncharm person once per day without spending spell\npoints. At 8th level, you gain the ability to teleport\nbetween trees. This requires your action, and the\ntrees must be within 100ft of each other. At 12th\nlevel, you no longer age and can cast entangle once\nper day without using a spell slot or points.\n* **Shadow**: Your image takes on a slight shimmering\nappearance. Nothing noticeable when anyone\nlooks directly at you, but from the corners of their\neyes, you seem to shimmer a bit. If you don’t\nalready have infravision, you gain infravision 60ft.\nWhen you cast an illusion spell of an inanimate\nobject, for one round per level, that object becomes\nreal and is tangible. At 8th level, when you cast\nan illusion of a creature or monster, that creature is\nsemi-tangible, having 50% the hit points, inflicting\nhalf damage of physical attacks, and assigned a\nbase AC of 15. This lasts for one round per level,\nand does not have any magical or special attacks\n(such as spells, paralyzing touch, or breath weapon)\nthat the inspiring creature has. The creature acts\non your turn, and takes your action to control the\nillusion. At 12th level, you can use your illusion\nshadow magic to replicate any spell from any other\nclass spell list. It can be of any spell level that you\ncan normally cast, but is costly--5 spell points per\nspell level of the spell being replicated.","classGroup":"arcane","xp":0,"requirements":{"str":0,"int":11,"wis":0,"dex":0,"con":10,"cha":0},"features":{"n16pqqzhvfj115wy":{"level":1,"title":"Combat Cantrip","content":"Like wizards, sorcerers\nhave managed to learn how to channel minor energies\nwithout spending spell points.

{"_id":"XZsUHJbAJCgYEWc8","name":"Wizard","type":"class","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"Wizards are the most flexible of the arcane classes,\nhaving the most broad spell choices, and the flexibility\nto switch between which spells they have prepared.\nThey keep their spells they collect in spellbooks, which\nthey must study every time they want to learn a spell\nthat has previously been cast, or to replace a currently\nmemorized spell with a new one. The spell table\non the Spellcasting tab dictates how many spells, and at what levels,\ncan be memorized by the wizard. For example, Johax\nis a 5th level wizard, so they can memorize a total of\n4 first level spells, 2 second level spells, and 1 third\nlevel spell.\n\n### Preparing Spells\nIn order to prepare and memorize each spell, the\nwizard must spend 15 minutes per spell level studying\ntheir spellbook in order to lock the spell into memory.\nThere it remains until the spell is cast, or is replaced\nby another spell. In the above example, Johax must\nspend a total of (4x15min)+(2x30min)+(1x45min)=2\nhours, 45 minutes to memorize all of their spells.\nEach spell requires its own slot. For example, if\nyou want to be able to cast two magic missiles, then\nyou would need to devote two slots to that spell. You\ncannot cast a spell you have not prepared and have\na slot dedicated to. Please note that you can use a\nhigher level slot to prepare any lower level spell. This\nalone does not impact the power of the spell, however;\ncaster level does that.\n\n### Casting Spells\nUnless otherwise noted, it takes the PC’s action\nto cast a spell. Spells will have one or more of the\nfollowing requirements: verbal (V), somatic (S), and\nmaterial (M) components. If a spell requires a spell\ncomponent such as bat dung, a somatic component\nlike a hand gesture, and a verbal component such as\nutterance of magic incantations, then in order to cast\nthe spell all three would be necessary. If any of them\nare missing, the spell cannot be cast. Once cast, the\nspell is immediately erased from memory.\nSpells are a risky endeavor, and can be interrupted.\nIf you are casting a spell and have not completed it\nyet (it hasn’t been your turn yet) and you take damage\nor are bound, then the spell is interrupted and wasted.\nThis is a key reason (along with weak AC and hit\npoints) that most wizards avoid combat and stay in the\nrear where it’s safer.\n\n### Learning and Adding Spells\nPlease reference the Intelligence Table for the %\nchance of learning any new spell you might come\nacross. If you are successful in your attempt, you can\ninscribe the spell into your spellbook for your own\nuse in the future. If you fail, then you are not able to\nlearn the spell until you gain a level, at which point a\nnew attempt can be made. This table also advises you\nof the maximum number of spells by level that you can\nhave in your spellbook.\n\nWizards begin play with 4 spells in their spellbook:\n@Compendium[chromatic-dungeons-compendia.spell.LmfxyVTzoT35csYA]{Read Magic}, one offensive spell, one defensive spell,\nand one additional spell of your choice.
