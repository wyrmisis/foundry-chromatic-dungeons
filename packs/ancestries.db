Many dwarves\nhave beards regardless of gender or lack thereof,\nand wear them with pride. The most common cultures\nof dwarves include but are not limited to mountain,\nhill, and deep dwarves.\n\n### Hill Dwarves\n\nHill dwarves are possibly the most common\ndwarves typically encountered by other people, as\nthey make their homes above ground and are active\nwith trading and building alliances with other peoples.\nThey typically are a bit taller than other dwarves,\nstanding close to 5ft in height.\n\n### Mountain Dwarves\n\nMountain dwarves are more reclusive, making their\nhomes in fortresses and citadels deep within mountain\npasses or the within the mountain itself. They are\nbetween 4 and 5ft in height, but a bit stockier than\ntheir hill dwarf cousins. \n\n### Deep Dwarves\n\nDeep dwarves are the shortest dwarves, standing\nno more than 4ft in height on average, and live deep\nin subterranean communities. Often, a deep dwarf\nwill never see the sun or the surface for their entire\nlifespan. Their skin tone covers various shades of\ngrey, and their eyes and ears are slightly enlarged\ncompared to other dwarven proportions. Like most\ndwarves, they have beards, although their hair is\nalmost always white or a light shade of grey."},"effects":[{"_id":"bgnS0B2vswNr4YDH","changes":[{"key":"data.senses.infravision","mode":4,"value":"60"}],"disabled":false,"duration":{"startTime":null},"icon":"icons/svg/aura.svg","label":"Infravision","origin":"Compendium.foundry-chromatic-dungeons.ancestry.2U6ABfX4qTLHuNHs","transfer":true,"flags":{},"tint":""},{"_id":"GCsgGiJFDZQQMRFl","changes":[{"key":"data.languages","mode":0,"value":"Common"},{"key":"data.languages","mode":0,"value":"Dwarven"}],"disabled":false,"duration":{"startTime":null},"icon":"icons/svg/book.svg","label":"Ancestry Languages","origin":"Compendium.foundry-chromatic-dungeons.ancestry.2U6ABfX4qTLHuNHs","transfer":true,"flags":{},"tint":null},{"_id":"H0umlbtTNoj4Za2y","changes":[{"key":"data.resistances.bludgeoning","mode":2,"value":"1"}],"disabled":false,"duration":{"startTime":null},"icon":"icons/svg/aura.svg","label":"Bludgeoning Resistance","origin":"Compendium.foundry-chromatic-dungeons.ancestry.2U6ABfX4qTLHuNHs","transfer":true,"flags":{},"tint":null}],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"EySXu4BQzMx4ns8m":3},"flags":{}}

There\nare many different cultures of elves, with the most\ncommon being high elves, wood elves, and deep elves.\n\n### High Elf\n\nHigh elves are the most “civilized” and magical\nof all the elves, utilizing magic in all aspects of their\nculture. These are the most common type of elf that\nis typically encountered as they are the most likely\nto establish contact with other ancestries.\n\nTheir skin\ntone varies in relation to the climate they are found in,\nfrom temperate climates having a pale sand color to a\ngolden hue skin tone, with silky hair of gold, lavender,\nor silver color, to a high elf in a hot desert climate with\ndeep dark brown to bronze skin, and black to dark\nviolet hair. High elves have the longest ears of all\nelves, with the tips reaching as high as the top of their\nheads. Their features are chiseled, and skin blemish\nfree.\n\n### Wood Elf\n\nMaking their homes deep within the forests and\nwoodlands far away from civilized areas, wood elves\nhave a natural affinity for nature, going so far as\nto craft their homes to appear as natural extensions\nof trees and natural rock formations. It is for these\nreasons they are rarer to encounter among the various\npeoples, but it is not unknown for them to become\nadventurers, especially if their forest is threatened.\nWood elves rarely are taller than 5ft in height, and\nare slightly more robust in build than their high elf\ncousins, with bodies well suited for living in the wilds. \n\n### Deep Elf\n\nThe history behind deep elves is still largely a\nmystery. Some believe they were surface elves that\neons ago fled to the deep underground caverns for\nmany rumored reasons, such as plague, or having\nmade a pact with evil deities and were driven\nunderground. Others think they were normal elves\nwho were victims of dark and alien forces that\nevolved them into what they are now. And others\nbelieve they were just groups of elves who got lost or\ntrapped deep underground and formed their new life\nthere.\n\nRegardless of their history, current deep elves\nmake their homes in cities deep underground in huge\ncaverns, most never seeing the surface world for their\nentire lives. Their cities are heavily influenced by\nmagic and alien influences, and thus reflect that to\nany outsider visiting them. Due to their isolation and\nenvironment where they are surrounded by deadly\ncreatures, many deep elves tend to be mistrusting of\nother ancestries.\n\nHaving generations live deep underground, deep\nelves have taken on several evolutionary traits. Their\nnatural skin color ranges from porcelain white to a\nshades of blue or pale purple, and they have extra\nlarge eyes and ears to enhance their senses. Many\nwho have encountered deep elves underground\nassume they have dark skin, almost black, because\nthey have a natural ability to shift the pigment in their\nskin to reflect basic colors of the terrain around them,\nwhich being underground is almost always dark stone.\nThis grants dark elves a bonus +2 to all stealth checks."},"effects":[{"_id":"KUfUv3YLPVuJ978I","changes":[{"key":"data.languages","mode":0,"value":"Common"},{"key":"data.languages","mode":0,"value":"Elven"}],"disabled":false,"duration":{"startTime":null},"icon":"icons/svg/book.svg","label":"Ancestry Languages","origin":"Compendium.foundry-chromatic-dungeons.ancestry.ttJPjtPIQ6ZZ7Gbk","transfer":true,"flags":{},"tint":null},{"_id":"rgfqGPxmEjysLR1O","changes":[{"key":"data.senses.infravision","mode":4,"value":"60"}],"disabled":false,"duration":{"startTime":null},"icon":"icons/svg/aura.svg","label":"Infravision","origin":"Compendium.foundry-chromatic-dungeons.ancestry.ttJPjtPIQ6ZZ7Gbk","transfer":true,"flags":{},"tint":""}],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"EySXu4BQzMx4ns8m":3},"flags":{}}
