Often, a deep dwarf will never see the sun or the surface for their entire lifespan.

There are many different cultures of elves, with the most common being high elves, wood elves, and deep elves.</p>\n<h3>High Elf</h3>\n<p>High elves are the most &ldquo;civilized&rdquo; and magical of all the elves, utilizing magic in all aspects of their culture. These are the most common type of elf that is typically encountered as they are the most likely to establish contact with other ancestries.</p>\n<p>Their skin tone varies in relation to the climate they are found in, from temperate climates having a pale sand color to a golden hue skin tone, with silky hair of gold, lavender, or silver color, to a high elf in a hot desert climate with deep dark brown to bronze skin, and black to dark violet hair. High elves have the longest ears of all elves, with the tips reaching as high as the top of their heads. Their features are chiseled, and skin blemish free.</p>\n<h3>Wood Elf</h3>\n<p>Making their homes deep within the forests and woodlands far away from civilized areas, wood elves have a natural affinity for nature, going so far as to craft their homes to appear as natural extensions of trees and natural rock formations. It is for these reasons they are rarer to encounter among the various peoples, but it is not unknown for them to become adventurers, especially if their forest is threatened.</p>\n<p>Wood elves rarely are taller than 5ft in height, and are slightly more robust in build than their high elf cousins, with bodies well suited for living in the wilds.</p>\n<h3>Deep Elf</h3>\n<p>The history behind deep elves is still largely a mystery. Some believe they were surface elves that eons ago fled to the deep underground caverns for many rumored reasons, such as plague, or having made a pact with evil deities and were driven underground. Others think they were normal elves who were victims of dark and alien forces that evolved them into what they are now. And others believe they were just groups of elves who got lost or trapped deep underground and formed their new life there.</p>\n<p>Regardless of their history, current deep elves make their homes in cities deep underground in huge caverns, most never seeing the surface world for their entire lives. Their cities are heavily influenced by magic and alien influences, and thus reflect that to any outsider visiting them. Due to their isolation and environment where they are surrounded by deadly creatures, many deep elves tend to be mistrusting of other ancestries.</p>\n<p>Having generations live deep underground, deep elves have taken on several evolutionary traits. Their natural skin color ranges from porcelain white to a shades of blue or pale purple, and they have extra large eyes and ears to enhance their senses. Many who have encountered deep elves underground assume they have dark skin, almost black, because they have a natural ability to shift the pigment in their skin to reflect basic colors of the terrain around them, which being underground is almost always dark stone. This grants deep elves a bonus +2 to all stealth checks.</p>"},"ownership":{"default":0,"EySXu4BQzMx4ns8m":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"foundry-chromatic-dungeons","systemVersion":"auto-replaced","coreVersion":"10.276","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1659472209581,"lastModifiedBy":"SJYXVyi92RXetdPu"}}
