Regardless of sphere or wall, the protective barrier consists of several layers of colors, each with its own effect as described below.  Each layer offers a form of protection, and will also cause a negative effect to any creature that tries to pass through the wall.  Each layer also is noted with what is needed to dispel that particular layer.  Note that the layers have to be disabled in order.  Casting a disintegrate spell while the orange layer is still there will have no effect to the yellow layer.
