Even though plants have no intelligence, this spell allows them to convey things they may have experienced through their senses.  Therefore, a patrol of orcs that passed by may be described as leaves and branches buckling and breaking against human sized creatures, with the odor of orcs.  Sometimes, the plants can also be convinced to move for the caster, such as swaying to the side or parting out of the way.  This is entirely up to GM discretion, and the caster may have to do something in return that benefits the plant.","save":"None"},"effects":[],"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"foundry-chromatic-dungeons","systemVersion":"auto-replaced","coreVersion":"10.276","createdTime":1659412085972,"modifiedTime":1659412085972,"lastModifiedBy":"stlguzWb9kIcPniF"},"_id":"wrI24C6jEoZn683u","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"stlguzWb9kIcPniF":3}}
