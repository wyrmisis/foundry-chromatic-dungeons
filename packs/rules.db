Combat participants can choose to attempt a special attack. If successful, these result in additional benefits to the attacker but are often harder to land. Unless otherwise noted, each attempt at a special attack will replace one of your normal attacks for that round.</p>\n<h2>Called Shot</h2>\n<p>A Called Shot is when you specifically target a particular body part or area of the main target. This may be advantageous against armored opponents who might have a soft spot, or at a hand holding an object, or trying to hit a button on a larger object, etc. Because of the difficulty, a called shot imparts a -4 penalty to the attack roll.</p>\n<h2>Disarm</h2>\n<p>This attack can target held items only; natural weapons are immune to this maneuver. To disarm an opponent, you make a standard attack roll. If successful, you make a contested dexterity ability check against the target instead of doing damage. Whoever has the best result wins the contest, either disarming the target or resisting the disarm attempt.</p>\n<h2>Grapple</h2>\n<p>Instead of attacking, you may choose to grapple your target. You and the target will make strength or dexterity ability checks (each participant decides which ability score to use). Whoever succeeded the most (or failed by the least) will win, and the other target will be grappled. A grappled target can take no action other than to break free on their turn.</p>\n<h2>Unarmed Combat</h2>\n<p>Unless otherwise noted, unarmed attacks inflict one bludgeoning point of damage, plus any strength modifiers.</p>\n<h2>Mounted Combat</h2>\n<p>Historically, there is a reason why mounted attackers were more effective. Attacking while mounted brings certain advantages. First, attacks made against any large or smaller creature that isn’t mounted will receive a +1 bonus to attack rolls. Secondly, when charging a target (having the mount move at least 20’ in a straight line before attacking) and armed with a lance or spear, a successful attack roll will result in double damage, after all modifiers are applied.</p>\n<p>The drawback is that opponents may target the mount instead of the player, or the mount may be subject to area-of-effect spells or other scenarios. A skilled rider can help mitigate these hazards. If your mount suffers 50% of its hit point total, it must make a morale check. If it suffers 25% or more of its hit point total in one attack, it must make a constitution check or rear up, throwing the rider off, and flee. If you ask the mount to do something unusual, like leaping over a high fence or ravine, you may be called to make a strength check for the mount (difficulty determined by the GM based on scenario). These are just some examples. Note that someone with the equestrian heritage will apply a +3 bonus to these checks. </p>\n<h2>Shove</h2>\n<p>Instead of using your weapons to attack, you attempt to shove the creature up to 10’ away. You and your target need to make a strength ability check. Whoever has the best result wins. If you win, the target is shoved up to 10’ away. If they win and resist your shove, they will gain a +2 bonus to their next attack against you if made within one round, taking advantage of the opening you gave them.</p>\n<h2>Trip</h2>\n<p>Rather than make a typical attack roll with a weapon, you make a special tripping attack roll. If successful, the target creature might trip and fall prone. For creatures that are your size, they will need to make a successful dexterity ability check or fall prone. Creatures smaller than your size have to make this check at a -4 penalty applied to their DEX score. For creatures one size larger than you, they also have to make a dexterity ability check, but gain a +4 bonus to their DEX score. Creatures two sizes or larger than you gain a +8 bonus.</p>\n<h2>Two-weapon Fighting</h2>\n<p>Often you may choose to fight with a weapon in each hand. Several fictional archetypes, such as the dashing swashbuckler, showcase this style. While gaining the obvious bonus of making an additional attack with this off-hand weapon, unskilled users will suffer a penalty when trying to do so. The first is that the off-hand weapon must be a light weapon, including daggers, short swords, hand axes, horseman’s weapons (flail, mace, etc), whip, clubs, darts, sickles, and hand crossbows. The second is that all attacks with the primary weapon suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls, and the off-hand weapon suffer a -4 penalty. Some class features (such as the thief’s ability) may completely mitigate or eliminate these penalties.</p>\n<p> </p>"},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":200000,"ownership":{"default":-1,"stlguzWb9kIcPniF":3},"flags":{}},{"name":"Natural Hazards","type":"text","_id":"gN4wCDVvXQnUN9rL","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h2>Falling</h2>\n<p>Whether it’s a pit trap, a cliff, or a wall, there may be a time when a PC falls and lands upon a hard surface. For every 10’ distance fallen, the creature suffers [[/r 1d6]] damage.</p>\n<h2>Swimming &amp; Drowning</h2>\n<p>For ease of play, assuming PCs are exceptional compared to the normal person, it is assumed every adventurer has learned to swim at some point. Treading calm water isn’t all that difficult. However, if the water is rough, or if the PC is wearing heavy gear, then it becomes much more challenging. As a baseline every PC can swim 10’ per round unencumbered for an amount of rounds (minutes) equal to their constitution score. Past this point, the PC must make a constitution ability check for every 10 minutes of continued swimming. Failure results in the PC becoming too fatigued and is beginning to drown (see below). The following factors will modify this base rule:</p>\n<table border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col><col></col><col></col></colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Encumbrance</td>\n<td>Swim Speed Penalty</td>\n<td>Constitution Check Penalty</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>25-50%</td>\n<td>-5ft</td>\n<td>-5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>51-100%</td>\n<td>1ft total</td>\n<td>-10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wearing chain or plate armor</td>\n<td>-5ft</td>\n<td>-7</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Any character who fails their ability check will begin drowning. As a base rule, a character can hold their breath without impact for two rounds per constitution modifier to their hit die roll, minimum 1. If the character has a high enough constitution score to gain a bonus of +3 HP per level, they can hold their breath for up to 6 rounds without being negatively impacted. From that point on, they will begin to drown.</p>\n<p>The PC will lose 5 constitution points for every round beyond this allowance. When the constitution score reaches or goes below 0, the character has drowned and died. If the character can get air and reset before reaching 0 constitution, they will regain 1 point for every turn (10 minutes) rested, up to their maximum. When the PC gets air for a new breath, this entire process resets from the top (lost constitution remains until they take the appropriate time to rest).</p>\n<p>For example, if Grar has a constitution score of 16 and a +2 bonus to hit points, they can hold their breath for four rounds. On the fifth round of continuing to hold their breath, Grar will suffer a -5 penalty to their constitution score. Grar spends another round underwater before rising and getting a breath, so the penalty total is -10. They get a breath at the end of their turn and can go back underwater for another four rounds before losing additional constitution points. However, those 10 lost points won’t recover until Grar rests for 100 minutes.</p>\n<h2>Mud/Rock Slides &amp; Avalanches</h2>\n<p>Traveling the wilderness, especially in harsh conditions, can be dangerous for the party. If a character finds themselves in the path of a mudslide or rock avalanche, they are in dire straits indeed!</p>\n<p>If a mudslide is only a foot or two in depth, then the PCs must make a dexterity ability check or fall prone, possibly resulting in them being covered by the mud completely and pushed “downriver” of the mudflow. Even with a successful check, they may find themselves knee or waist-deep in mud, being completely restrained.</p>\n<p>If the mudslide is greater than half their height, they will automatically be knocked prone and covered with mud. Unless there were precautions made or some other magical prevention, rules for drowning apply. Again, much of this is up to GM discretion.</p>\n<p>As a general rule for falling rocks, each rock the size of a fist or larger that the character risks being struck by requires the character to make a dexterity ability check. A failed check results in damage being taken depending on the size of the rock:</p>\n<table border=\"1\"><colgroup><col></col><col></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Diameter</td>\n<td>Damage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4-6in</td>\n<td>[[/r 1d6]]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7-10in</td>\n<td>[[/r 1d8]]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11-15in</td>\n<td>[[/r 1d10]]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2-3ft</td>\n<td>[[/r 2d8]]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3-5ft</td>\n<td>[[/r 3d10]]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5-10ft</td>\n<td>[[/r 5d10]]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10ft or more</td>\n<td>[[/r 5d20]]</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Avalanches work in the same way as mud slides, with the exception that PCs have twice as long to breathe before suffering drowning effects.</p>\n<h2>Quicksand &amp; Tar Pit</h2>\n<p>Any creature that manages to find itself in a tar pit or quicksand will find itself begin to sink at a slow rate.</p>\n<p>The character will sink 1 foot per round unless helped in some manner. Once submerged, the character will suffer the effects of drowning. Creatures can attempt to move or “swim” through quicksand or tar by making a strength ability check at a -5 penalty assessed to the roll for every 5’ moved.</p>\n<h2>Desecrated Ground</h2>\n<p>When you think of hazards, desecrated ground probably isn’t one of those that leap to mind. However, if an area is desecrated through vile means, it takes on an actual evil taint that impacts everything in the area. Typically, an area becomes desecrated when something of great evil occurs there, such as large-scale sacrifice and demon worship, or other forms of extreme brutality, or when the graves of the dead have been repeatedly disturbed.</p>\n<p>Any lawful aligned creature within a desecrated area will suffer a -1 penalty to all attack rolls, ability check rolls, and saving throws as long as the area remains desecrated.</p>"},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":300000,"ownership":{"default":-1,"stlguzWb9kIcPniF":3},"flags":{}},{"name":"Poisons, Venoms, and Diseases","type":"text","_id":"H4oI0nurXYL6vnME","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h2>Poison</h2>\n<p>Weak and Mild poisons are typically plant-based, such as many types of poisonous leaves, flowers, or other mild effects that cause discomfort and painful cramping but rarely death.

Mild and moderate diseases will heal on their own over time. Lost ability score points will begin to recover at 1 point per week.<br />Severe and deadly diseases, however, will not resolve on their own. If not cured, they will eventually lead to the PCs death.

All traps are meant to either harm intruders or prevent them from continuing. Some people will argue that the impact of traps is just as significant, if not greater, than actual monsters in the adventure. No dungeon delver worth their salt will go into a dungeon or monster lair and not expect some trap.</p>\n<p>When crafting traps, keep in mind that the complexity of the trap is limited to the thinking capability of the creature making it and the resources available to craft it. Therefore, a lower intelligent creature such as a goblin might have crafted crude pit traps and other booby traps. In contrast, an intelligent creature with access to items such as acid, metals, or magic will create more complex traps. A trap created by dwarves in their stronghold may include levers, gears, and huge stone blocks, while the aforementioned goblins in their dug-out cavern might only have a pit trap filled with snakes.</p>\n<p>Some of the more common traps are described with typical effects in the table below. Unless otherwise stated, most of the damaging effects of traps can be reduced or avoided with a successful saving throw or dexterity ability check (as determined by the GM).</p>\n<h2>Basic Pit Trap</h2>\n<p><em>[[/r 1d6]] pts of damage for every 10’ fallen, reflex save for half</em></p>\n<p>This is your garden variety simple pit dug into the ground, often covered up by camouflaging material to hide it. Unsuspecting individuals who step on the trap area will fall through to the depth of the pit. The pit walls are generally hewn smooth to prevent someone from easily climbing out. Often these pits are filled with other hazardous materials.</p>\n<h2>Spike Lined Pit Trap</h2>\n<p><em>[[/r 1d10]] pts of damage for every 10’ fallen, dexterity check for half</em></p>\n<p>This is basically a standard pit trap lined with sharpened stakes or spikes along the floor.</p>\n<h2>Crushing Block/Wall Trap</h2>\n<p><em>[[/r 5d10]] points of damage, reflex save for half</em></p>\n<p>This trap is most often represented by the walls moving inward or the ceiling moving downward to crush whoever is in the area. It also includes those traps where the ceiling releases and falls onto the ground, damaging anything underneath it.</p>\n<h2>Gas Trap</h2>\n<p><em>Save vs. Poison or suffer the effects of the gas cloud.</em></p>\n<p>These devious traps are usually built within a chest or other object that the owner doesn’t want to be opened. A hidden mechanism will shatter a vial that contains a dangerous gas. Once triggered, the cloud will instantly fill a 10’ diameter area. Any creature within the area will have to make a saving throw vs. poison or suffer the effects of the gas. This can vary from poison gas, hallucinatory gas, sleeping gas, or anything else the GM desires.</p>\n<h2>Oil Trap</h2>\n<p><em>Target may be subject to drowning effects as well as [[/r 1d8]] points of fire damage per round once oil is lit</em></p>\n<p>Often combined with a pit trap, once triggered these traps open portals at the top of the pit and will begin to have oil (or other liquid) pour forth, filling the area. Shortly after, typically a lit torch or other incendiary device will follow, setting the pit on fire.</p>\n<h2>Poison Needle Trap</h2>\n<p><em>Save vs. Poison or suffer poison effects</em></p>\n<p>These types of traps are typically hidden within locks or other mechanical devices as a single poisoned needle. When sprung, the needle will pierce the person attempting to manipulate the object and if a saving throw vs. Poison is not made, they will suffer the type of poison’s effects.</p>\n<h2>Punji Stick Trap</h2>\n<p><em>[[/r 1d4]] points of damage, save vs. Disease or become infected with mild disease</em></p>\n<p>This is a shallow pit lined with sharpened stakes made with the intent that the victim will step on the trap. The greater danger isn’t the spikes themselves, but that they are often coated in feces or other filth. Any creature stepping on this trap will need to make a save vs. Disease or suffer the effects of a mild disease (see below).</p>\n<h2>Swinging Spiked Trap</h2>\n<p><em>[[/r 2d8]] points of damage, reflex save to avoid</em></p>\n<p>This trap comes in several variations but they all have in common the basic mechanics: a heavy spiked ball, or tree limb, or log that swings down for from the side in a spring trap, hitting the creature that triggered it.</p>\n<h2>Teleportation Trap</h2>\n<p><em>Subject is teleported to predetermined location</em><br />A very unusual trap, and one rarely encountered due to the challenges in creating it, the teleportation trap will instantly teleport any creature that triggers it to a predetermined area. A particularly devious version of this trap is to have the teleportation trap at the bottom of a long pit, teleporting the victim(s) back to the top, repeating forever.</p>"},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":400000,"ownership":{"default":-1,"stlguzWb9kIcPniF":3},"flags":{}},{"name":"Monstrosities","type":"text","_id":"bIqjhmiqXa4Y8LNu","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Not all hazards are those naturally occurring or considered a trap. The horrors of a dungeon include many monstrosities that are better-considered hazards rather than monsters you usually fight in a typical combat encounter. These are considered Monstrosity Hazards, and are some of the most feared hazards an adventurer can encounter.</p>\n<h2>Green slime</h2>\n<p>This hazard typically covers a 10’ square area, often clinging to a ceiling hoping living creatures walk underneath it unnoticed. While sentient, it does not have any actual intelligence; it’s slightly more responsive than a predatory plant like a Venus Fly Trap. If any creature walks underneath the slime, it will drop to envelop that creature, using its natural corrosive ability to eat away at the organic tissue of the prey.</p>\n<p>The slime will dissolve 2 inches of wood or 1 inch of metal per round (essentially making armor worthless after 1 round). It cannot be brushed away but can be burned or frozen away (the victim also takes the same damage) once it suffers a total of 10 points of damage. A cure disease spell will immediately kill the slime, and it is immune to all other forms of attack. The unfortunate victim will turn into a green slime themselves after [[/r 1d6+1]] rounds have transpired if they do not take action to remove it. The slime can move 10’ per round.</p>\n<h2>Poisonous Fungi</h2>\n<p>This fungus comes in all shapes and sizes, but one consistent thing is that any creature that comes within 10’ of this “creature” will cause it to expel a cloud of spores. Unless a saving throw vs. Disease is made, the creature will contract a severe disease, as described below. Only a wish spell will bring lost constitution points back.</p>\n<h2>Rot Grubs</h2>\n<p>This dungeon horror appears as a normal maggot one finds in any decaying material. However, they have a horrible trait not shared by their lesser cousins—they have an intense desire for fresh blood. If a rot grub is exposed to the skin or flesh of a creature, it will begin to bore into the body of the poor creature. The grub travels one foot per round, tunneling towards the target’s heart. Once it reaches the heart, the victim will die. A cure disease spell will instantly kill any infested grubs, but short of that, unless quick action is taken in that first round, the victim may be forced to view amputation as an option.</p>\n<h2>Screeching Fungi</h2>\n<p>These are large fungi appearing as mushrooms covered in hollow chambers on their cap. Whenever they sense a creature moving within 15’ of them, the fungi will begin to contract quickly, and a loud screeching noise will emit from the cavities of their caps.</p>\n<h2>Sleeping Flower</h2>\n<p>These flowers appear as any other small grove of ornamental flowers. However, they will emit a cloud of pollen in a 5’ radius of where they were disturbed. Any creature failing their saving throw vs. poison will instantly fall into a deep sleep that lasts for [[/r 1d4]] hours. Nothing short of a restoration spell will awaken them. They often share the same grove as vampiric grass (see below).</p>\n<h2>Vampiric Grass</h2>\n<p>At first glance, this appears as normal crabgrass with a slight reddish tinge. Close inspection reveals that each blade of grass is covered with sharp barbs. Any creature that sits or lays in the grass will be attacked by it, suffering [[/r 1d4]] points of damage each round they remain, as the grass leaches the blood out of the victim.</p>"},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":600000,"ownership":{"default":-1,"stlguzWb9kIcPniF":3},"flags":{}},{"name":"Example Monstrous Maneuvers","type":"text","_id":"xyu1IVTDN3dxop5f","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h2>Natural Attack and Magic Resistance</h2>\n<p>Many types of monsters are resistant or immune to non-magical attacks. As a general rule, any monster with a HD of 6 or higher will be able to harm such resisted opponents as normal.</p>\n<h2>Monster Special Attacks</h2>\n<p>PCs aren’t the only ones who can perform special attacks or maneuvers. Any intelligent monster armed with weapons can utilize the same rules. Additionally, many monsters have additional special attacks that PCs must be wary of. These are explained as follows:</p>\n<h2>Disease</h2>\n<p>When a successful attack roll is made, some creatures, such as a mummy, will impart a diseased curse upon the target. As detailed in the hazards section, the monster type determines this disease and will have the appropriate effect.  </p>\n<h2>Level Drain</h2>\n<p>Many undead and some traps may drain the levels from a character when they make a successful attack roll or are triggered. Whenever a character loses a level, they lose everything associated with that level. They will have their experience points equal to the minimum amount for the lower level they were just knocked down to. This includes spellcasting ability, hit points, and any class features gained. Short of a wish spell, lost levels cannot be regained, and the PC must acquire new experience points to level up.</p>\n<h2>Paralysis</h2>\n<p>Some creatures can inflict paralysis upon target creatures.

{"name":"Character Creation and Advancement","pages":[{"name":"Advancement","type":"text","_id":"shZWka06C1SzCtwm","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Your character needs a certain amount of experience points to advance to the next level. Experience points are gained in many ways, from accomplishing goals to defeating monsters, acquiring treasure, successful ability checks, or GM awards. When you earn enough experience points to reach the next level, you do not automatically gain that next level. Rather, you need to be trained first.</p>\n<h2>Training</h2>\n<p>Training is typically done between sessions with a respective trainer, and costs 1000gp per level that is being advanced. Training time also takes between [[/r 1d4+1]] weeks. Therefore, if you are level 5 and gain enough experience to reach level 6, you need to spend 6,000gp and [[/r 1d4+1]] weeks of training before you can gain the benefits of leveling.</p>\n<h2>Earning XP</h2>\n<p>As mentioned, your PC can gain experience from defeating monsters, gaining treasure, or awards from the GM for role-playing, ability checks, etc.</p>\n<h3>From Monsters</h3>\n<p>Each monster will have an experience point value assigned to it based on that monster’s hit dice (see the following table). Keep in mind that you can gain the experience for defeating the monster encounter, which does not necessarily mean beating it in combat. While that is the most common way, you can also gain the award for finding a creative way to get around that encounter. You can do this through parlay or subterfuge. Either way, you may only earn the experience award one time for each monster.</p>\n<h3>From Treasure</h3>\n<p>An experience award for treasure is the fastest way to gain experience. That’s the end goal of the adventurers after all! Find treasure hordes and become rich! This motivation is reflected in the experience award for various types of treasure. For every gold piece value of pieces, gems, and jewelry a PC permanently acquires, they will gain 1 experience point. By “permanently acquire”, that means the treasure belongs to the PC. You can’t pass around a magic item worth 1000xp between PCs and expect them all to gain the benefit. Only one PC can gain that benefit. Any pieces, gems, or jewelry that the PC spends towards their benefit will also gain that award. E.g., if a PC gets 1500gp, but gives 500 of that away that benefits someone else, then they only gain 1000 experience points.</p>\n<h3>Other Sources</h3>\n<p>GM experience awards are a much greater gray area. Some GMs will grant XP bonuses for good role-playing or when your PC completes an essential skill or ability check. Other GMs may grant awards for accomplishing important goals in the game. How XP awards are given specifically is up to the GM. It is encouraged that you get together with your gaming group to discuss how XP is handled beforehand. </p>"},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1,"stlguzWb9kIcPniF":3},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"stlguzWb9kIcPniF":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.8AAZ1qq1QhELkWND"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"foundry-chromatic-dungeons","systemVersion":"auto-replaced","coreVersion":"10.276","createdTime":1659418492128,"modifiedTime":1659418492128,"lastModifiedBy":"stlguzWb9kIcPniF"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"Ljr6bg1uyNAcDxrx"}
