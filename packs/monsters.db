This carries over even if the troll is reduced to 0 hp or less, or even if limbs are removed (the limb will continue to attack or will crawl back to the body).  The only way to truly destroy a troll is to expose it to fire or acid once it's reduced to 0 hp or less.  Two headed trolls are just that: trolls with two heads.  They attack with two claws (reach of 10ft) and two bite attacks (reach of 5ft).  These trolls regenerate 1 hp per round, and cannot re-bond with severed limbs.  However, they do require fire or acid to permanently kill them, as with normal trolls.  Because they have two heads, with one always being awake, they cannot be surprised.

Most typical trolls are either shades of grey or green, with stringy hair infused with moss, and elongated facial features, standing more than 8ft tall.  The most fearsome ability of trolls is their ability to regenerate 3 hp per round at the start of its turn.  This carries over even if the troll is reduced to 0 hp or less, or even if limbs are removed (the limb will continue to attack or will crawl back to the body).  The only way to truly destroy a troll is to expose it to fire or acid once it's reduced to 0 hp or less.  Two headed trolls are just that: trolls with two heads.  They attack with two claws (reach of 10ft) and two bite attacks (reach of 5ft).  These trolls regenerate 1 hp per round, and cannot re-bond with severed limbs.  However, they do require fire or acid to permanently kill them, as with normal trolls.  Because they have two heads, with one always being awake, they cannot be surprised.  Ice trolls appear as normal trolls in size and shape, except they appear to be carved from solid blocks of ice.

If forced to fight, it will attack with two talons if airborne, or one beak attack if on the ground.  The phoenix is highly resistance to weapons, requiring a magic weapon of “rare” rarity or rarer in order to affect it.  The creature constantly has the following effects active: detect charm, detect chaos, detect magic, and radiates a protection from fear in a 10ft radius.  It can become astral or ethereal at will, and once per week can teleport itself and 10 medium sized creatures to the elemental plane of fire. Phoenixes are immune to being surprised, and gain +3 bonuses to initiative rolls.  It has infravision up to 120ft and can see in the dark in detail also up to 120ft.  Once per day it can also cast heal, cure disease, and take it's action to cure light wounds once per round.  In addition to all of these, the phoenix also has the spellcasting ability of an 11th level druid. Finally, the phoenix has two additional abilities that is can use if pressed.  It can fire 6 feathers per round at targets up to 60ft away, with each feather acting like a 5d6 fireball with a 10ft radius.  Lastly, as an act of desperation, it can invoke a powerful firestorm ability that acts as a combination of both the firestorm and incendiary cloud spells, as if it were a 40th level caster.

Black bears are slightly smaller than a human, while brown and polar bears are roughly twice as large, standing up to 8ft in height when on two legs.  Cave bears are massive, standing well over 12ft in height. All bears, if they are successful in hitting the same opponent with both of its claw attacks in the same round, will bring the opponent in for a bear hug, automatically inflicting damage equal to twice the die for a claw attack.  If used in this way, the bear will not get additional claw attacks on subsequent rounds, but the victim will automatically suffer damage. In addition to the bear hug, if a bear is dropped to below half of its maximum hit point total, it will enter a frenzy, gaining damage resistance.  This resistance will reduce all incoming damage to the bear by half, and will last until the bear dies or there are no more opponents to attack.","bio":"","type":"beast","numberAppearing":"1","size":"huge","perceptionMod":"2","treasure":"Black, brown, and polar bears don't often bring back prey to their lairs, so treasure would be very rare.
